# Scrumdinger App (Learning Swift)

Just following the tutorial to gain some experience working with Swift and SwiftUI.

# ProgressView
Essential a loading bar.

# Text and Label
Used to add text or text with label.

# HStack abd VStack
Creating a stack allows item to render in a stack fashion (either hori or vert).
(alignment: .leading/.trailing)

# List(vector[i]) { in i }
Create a list of the given object.

# NavigationStack
Add clickable item going to other views. use `.navigationTItle` to add title, and `.toolbar` to add extra function.

# .accessibilityelement and label)
For voice over.

# @State and @Binding
@State defines source of truth, meaning this is where the data is from, all other view using this data will reference the source of truth to get the data. Good practics to add `private` so the data can only be mutated within the view.

@Binding

# Form and TextField

# Modality
